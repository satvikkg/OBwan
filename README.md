This repository contains the dataset mined from CHEMBL and the for predicting oral-bioavailability for molecules.

## Oral-Bioavailability
Oral bioavailability (F%) is the fraction of an oral administered drug that reaches systemic circulation. Predicting the Oral bioavailability aid in designing/optimizing drug molecules.
